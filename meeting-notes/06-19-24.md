## 6/19/24 meeting with Taylor and Suzanne

### Prepared questions
#### Describe your idea briefly
We would like to compile and present art and simulations that demonstrate the theory and prevalence of complexity. Particularly, we are focusing on interactive media with an eye towards creating some kind of coherent exhibit. 
Current ideas include:
- Flocking simulations
- Beatpad for interactive chaos
- CSSS participant paintings
- CSSS participant collective guessing on estimation problems
- Collecting neat visualizations/explanations from other groups to feature
- Compiling the above into a website/idea for an exhibition

#### Do you have a research question? (It's ok if the answer is "not yet")
Can we actually do any of this?

#### What is everyone's role in the group?
We are all kinda doing our own things on the side, but 
Max - Team lead, working on beatpad hardware, collective intelligence projects
Galen - Collective painting project
Bhaskar - Website, evolutionary simulations
Sara - Data visualization, outreach/science communication
Ritam - Bird simulations

#### What do you expect to achieve by the end of summer school?
Get a website up that hosts some of these simulated projects, hopefully have some of the physical representations done too (collective canvases, beatpad chaos)
