# CSSS-arts
Code for playing around at CSSS 2024. 

Hosted at https://maxjerdee.github.io/CSSS-arts/

We plan to produce a website for hosting pretty demonstrations (and possibly explanations) of complexity in theory and practice. 

## Potential projects
- Flocking simulations
- Beatpad for interactive chaos
- CSSS participant paintings
- CSSS participant collective guessing on estimation problems

## Flocking simulation
https://xavibou.com/ornithographies/

## Beatpad chaos
Implementation of the game of life (and other cellular automata rules): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWq4AppMm8A
For controlling with javascript
https://github.com/rienheuver/launchpad-mini-mk3/tree/master

## Collective paintings
Get a bunch of canvases and paint with boundary conditions

## Collective intelligence
Have CSSS participants play this: https://www.wikiguess.io/ and look at the performance of the geo mean guesses against the individuals. 

## General inspirations
A book! https://makingwithdata.org/about


## How to edit these webpages
Install quarto, here are some instructions on installation on linux: https://quarto.org/docs/download/tarball.html

After that, can make edits to quarto_src and run `quarto render` in the `\quarto_src` directory.
