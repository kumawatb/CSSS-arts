# CSSS-arts
Code for playing around at CSSS 2024. 

We plan to produce a website for hosting pretty demonstrations (and possibly explanations) of complexity in theory and practice. 

## Potential projects
- Flocking simulations
- Beatpad for interactive chaos
- CSSS participant paintings
- CSSS participant collective guessing on estimation problems

## Flocking simulation

## Beatpad chaos
Implementation of the game of life (and other cellular automata rules): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWq4AppMm8A
For controlling with c++
https://github.com/giezu/LaunchkeyMiniMK3

## Collective paintings
Get a bunch of canvases and paint with boundary conditions

## Collective intelligence
Have CSSS participants play this: https://www.wikiguess.io/ and look at the performance of the geo mean guesses against the individuals. 

## General inspirations
A book! https://makingwithdata.org/about
